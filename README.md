# STARTER-jpa04

Starter code for jpa04

Assignment Description: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f25/lab/jpa04>

This lab is a repeat of lab00, i.e. a simple `"Hello, World!" type assignment to familiarize you with compiling Java using Maven, and submitting using Gradescope, but **with a twist**:
this time you are required to use **signed commits**.

See the lab description at <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f25/lab/jpa04.html> for more information and instructions on how to proceed.
